    <h1>Challenges and Setbacks</h1>
    <p>
      I faced many setbacks over the course of this project, primarily being my commitment to academics and other school responsibilites. Seasonal exams forced me to put the project on hold to study and prepare, which ultimately harmed progress and pacing.

      Atop schoolwork, the requisite knowledge to build a telescope proved to be a major obstacle. Understanding how the optics needed to function, alongside other mechanical details to get every instrument aligned, slowed the translation from design to construction considerably.

      But the most pressing issue was financing and sourcing parts. Telescope parts are manufactured to be very specific, and are thus very expensive. Sourcing parts through Agena Astro made the process more affordable and convenient, but the process was still at large a major hurdle.
