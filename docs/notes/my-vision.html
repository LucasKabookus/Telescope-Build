    <h1>My Vision</h1>
    <p>
      The superficial vision of my telescope was to fulfill my childhood dream of experiencing
      the stars and planets of our universe first-hand. It was the instrument that made that
      fantasy a tangible reality, my window into the secrets of the night sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      But more discrete was the telescope's opportunity to answer a personal call, one of what
      was possible to achieve, and with what reasonability. It was one thing to long for seeing
      the rings of Saturn or the red spot on Jupiter, but building a telescope was in and of
      itself a major constructional undertaking, let alone a complex and intricate piece of
      technology. The build cemented that a project—no matter how infeasible or impractical on
      the outside—was possible with the right mindset and commitment.

      The telescope held another purpose beyond being an instrument to observe the universe, however;
      the project marked the bridge between a curiosity in STEM and a solution in the real world,
      far more than any classroom could draw the connection. It represented the translation of
      learning—of knowledge in mechanics, optics, calculus—into action, into fuel for something
      tangible and valuable. A large part of my vision was tearing down that boundary between
      formula and physical. Beyond what the telescope itself was, the project brought my learning
      into life, made math speak into action, and let physics resonate in every streak of light
      captured by my mirrors. That—that was what made the final product so special, so unique,
      so real.
