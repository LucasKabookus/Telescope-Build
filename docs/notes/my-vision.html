    But more discrete was the telescope's opportunity to answer a personal call, one of what was possible to achieve, and with what reasonability. It was one thing to long for seeing the rings of Saturn or the red spot on Jupiter, but building a telescope was in and of itself a major constructional undertaking, let alone a complex and intricate piece of technology. The build cemented that a project—no matter how infeasible or impractical on the outside—was possible with the right mindset and commitment.

    The telescope held a purpose beyond being an instrument to observe the universe, however; the project marked the bridge between a curiosity in STEM and a solution in the real world, far more than any classroom could draw the connection. It represented the translation of learning—of knowledge in mechanics, optics, calculus—into action, into fuel for something tangible and valuable. A large part of my vision was tearing down that boundary between formula and physical. Beyond w
