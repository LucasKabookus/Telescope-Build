    <h1>Inspiration and Motivation</h1>
    <p>
      From a young age I always was enthralled with the vast sky above. The intrigue of having other star systems, worlds, and galaxies in sight but out of reach drove me to one day make contact with this unknown. I always had a knack for math and physics, and saw a perfect way to harness my knowledge in these fields to make my dream a reality.

      But I would be ignorant to neglect factors in the world around me that motivated this project: James Webb, Hubble, growing private spaceflight industries like SpaceX, RocketLabs, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin to name a few. These sources all proved that the technology I sought wasn't just possible but accessible, and even more relevant. On top of these sources of inspiration was a Gifted Independent Study program launching at my high school. I seized the opportunity and began construction. After 2 long years of designing, failing, testing, aligning, and constructing, the telescope finally came together, a monument marking the possibility of dreams. Nothing is too far out, not even the very stars and planets that dot our night sky, to achieve, no matter the cost, the rigor, the doubt. Perserverence, as I learned, triumphs all doubt. My dream had come true.

      I have my many mentors at school, my close friends David and Vivek, online sources of inspiration like John Dobson and astro YouTubers, and my father to thank for making this build possible--your dedication to motivating and propelling this project is embedded in the soul of what makes my telescope so special.
